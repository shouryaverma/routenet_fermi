# RouteNet-Fermi Reimplementation Project

THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY OF THE PAPER.

Original repository can be found here: https://github.com/BNN-UPC/RouteNet-Fermi/tree/main

This is the re-implementation of RouteNet-Fermi, a pioneering GNN architecture designed to model computer 
networks. RouteNet-Fermi supports complex traffic models, multi-queue scheduling policies, routing policies and 
can provide accurate estimates in networks not seen in the training phase.
